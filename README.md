# Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems

This repository contains coursework and project implementations for **EN.605.715 – Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems**.

The projects progress incrementally from basic embedded hardware control to real-time operating systems and embedded Linux integration. Later projects combine multiple subsystems into a complete quadcopter platform capable of acquiring and transmitting sensor and multimedia data in real time.
